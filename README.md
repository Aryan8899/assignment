# Profile Dashboard
## Project Overview

The Profile Dashboard is a responsive web application designed for laptop screens (768px and above). It features two main interactive components: a tabbed widget for displaying information ("About Me," "Experiences," and "Recommended") and a gallery widget with the ability to add images. The project focuses on creating a clean, responsive layout while accurately replicating specific UI details, such as padding, margins, shadows, and interactivity.
